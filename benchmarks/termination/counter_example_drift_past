# This is an example where the drift tends to negative infinity.
# However x is definitely not a supermartingale let alone a ranking one
# In essence There is a positive probability for y to take any negative value
# For x to be a supermartingale y would however have >= -1/2.

x = 10
y = 0
while x > 0:
    y = y + 2 @ 1/2; y - 1
    x = x - y
